# Re4ctoR-VRF/CSPRNG
Our product, "Fourth Reactor," combines a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG). It excels in performance and security. It passed all 15 out of 15 NIST tests, indicating a very high level of randomness and statistical quality. Its speed of over 90 MB/sec is exceptional, outperforming many competitors by a significant margin. Additionally, its Post-Quantum Readiness (specifically ML-DSA-65) is a crucial advantage for future-proofing applications against quantum computing threats.


High-performance cryptographic random number generator with post-quantum security focus.  Tested with NIST STS, Dieharder, and TestU01🔐⚡
# Re4ctoR: A Post-Quantum Verifiable Random Number Generator (VRNG)

## 📌 Project Overview
**Re4ctoR** is an innovative and cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG)
designed to address the most pressing challenges in modern cybersecurity.

Its unique hybrid architecture combines:
- principles of **chaotic systems**,
- state-of-the-art **cryptographic primitives**,
- a novel **entropy model**,

making it an ideal solution for **blockchain, cryptography, and Web3 applications**.

The key advantage of Re4ctoR is its **post-quantum resilience** and the ability to generate
**verifiable random numbers (VRNG)**, ensuring absolute transparency and trust.
