# 🏆 R4 vs Competitors — Comprehensive Comparison

End-to-end view of how R4 stacks up against VRF oracles, public beacons, cloud HSMs, and casino RNG providers.

---

## ⚠️ Context for Readers
...


**R4 right now:**
- Single-signer / self-hosted
- Ultra-low latency (<1 ms)
- On-chain verifiable (Solidity)
- Post-quantum roadmap

**Competitors like Chainlink/drand:**
- Multi-party decentralized beacons
- Strong for trust minimization
- Weak for latency/cost

**AWS / Thales:**
- Compliance HSM vendors
- Not provably fair randomness sources
- Good for key storage, not draw audits

**You shouldn't compare them apples-to-apples.** Compare by: what problem are you solving?

| Feature | **R4** | **Chainlink VRF** | **drand** | **API3 QRNG** | **AWS KMS** |
|---------|--------|------------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Post-Quantum Ready** | ✅ Dilithium3 + Kyber roadmap | ❌ ECDSA only | ❌ BLS (not PQ) | ❌ Classical | ⚠️ Classical only |
| **Latency** | **<1 ms** (local, instant) | ~30s–120s (block-confirmed) | ~30s beacon interval | ~15–20s oracle round | 10–50 ms API call |
| **Cost Model** | Self-hosted (flat infra) | **Pay-per-request** | Free (public beacon) | Oracle subscription | $$$ per month/op |

| **Self-Hosted** | ✅ Docker/systemd | ❌ No | ✅ Run your own node | ⚠️ Oracle model | ✅ (AWS lock-in) |
| **Audit Trail** | ✅ Full signature + timestamp | ✅ Proof on-chain | ✅ Public log | ⚠️ Oracle attestation | ❌ Opaque inside HSM |
| **FIPS 204 / PQ Path** | 🚀 In progress (Dilithium3, Kyber) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ 140-3 (classical) |

## 🔀 VRF Providers (On-Chain Randomness)

"I need randomness I can prove on-chain later."

| Feature | **R4** | **Chainlink VRF** | **API3 QRNG** | **Gelato VRF** | **Band Protocol** |
|---------|--------|------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Cost Model** | Self-hosted, zero per-request fees | Pay-per-request on-chain | Oracle feed (dAPI subscription) | Infra provider oracle fee | Oracle fee per call |
| **Latency** | Sub-millisecond (local) | Wait for fulfillment tx (tens of sec) | ~tens of seconds | ~tens of seconds | Depends on chain finality |
| **Verifiable On-Chain** | ✅ v,r,s + known signer in Solidity | ✅ VRF proof verified in contract | ✅ Provided proof | ✅ Provided proof | ✅ Oracle-signed round |
| **Decentralization** | ❌ Single signer (your node) | ✅ Network of oracles | ⚠️ Depends on provider | ⚠️ Centralized infra | ✅ Oracle committee |
| **Self-Hosted** | ✅ Yes, literally `docker run` | ❌ No | ⚠️ Generally no | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Post-Quantum Roadmap** | ✅ Dilithium3 signing mode | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Throughput** | ~950k req/sec | Rate-limited per req | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Best For** | Casinos, rollups, validators | Public DeFi apps needing neutrality | Mid-size DeFi protocols | Bots / automation workflows | Multi-chain consumers |

**Key insight:** R4 trades decentralization for speed & cost. You control the signer, but there's no threshold crypto (yet). That's a feature for many use cases, not a bug.

## 🎮 Gaming RNG Services

"I run chances/odds in a casino / raffle / lootbox and I need to prove to players I didn't cheat."

| Feature | **R4** | **Typical Casino RNG Provider (iTech, GLI, etc.)** | **Provably Fair Web APIs** |
|---------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Verifiable Per-Round** | ✅ Yes (ECDSA sig, timestamp) | ❌ No, you get a certificate | ⚠️ Usually "seed reveal" |
| **Player Can Audit Independently** | ✅ Yes, signature is public | ❌ No | ⚠️ Only if they trust server |
| **On-Chain Usable** | ✅ Yes (Solidity verifier included) | ❌ No | ⚠️ Mostly off-chain |
| **Latency** | <1 ms | 10–100 ms | 50–200 ms |
| **Throughput** | ~950k req/sec | ~50k req/sec | ~5–20k req/sec |
| **Deployment** | Self-hosted (Docker / systemd) | Vendor hardware or remote | Hosted SaaS |
| **Regulator Story** | "Every roll is signed" (strong) | "We were audited last year" (weak ongoing proof) | "We hash things" (weak) |
| **Cost** | Flat infra cost | $$$$ per month + audits | Subscription |

**R4 advantage:** Continuous cryptographic proof, not annual audit reports.

## 🏦 Enterprise HSM / Cloud KMS / Vault

"Big bank / compliance / SOC2 buyer / gaming regulator."

| Feature | **R4** | **AWS CloudHSM / KMS** | **Thales HSM / YubiHSM** |
|---------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Form Factor** | Docker / systemd | Managed cloud service | Physical hardware |
| **Setup Time** | ~30 min | 1–2 days (infra + IAM) | Days / procurement |
| **FIPS 140-3 Path** | ✅ "Ready" (self-test + attestation) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Per-Request Verifiable Proof** | ✅ Signature + timestamp per call | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Post-Quantum Roadmap** | ✅ Dilithium3 / Kyber | ❌ Classical only | ⚠️ Vendor roadmap |
| **On-Chain Usable** | ✅ Solidity verifier in repo | ❌ Not designed for that | ❌ Not designed for that |
| **Who Controls Keys** | You (self-host) | AWS | Vendor hardware |
| **Cost Model** | Your infra (low fixed) | $$$ per-op / per-hour | $$$$ capex |
| **Target Buyer** | Casinos, chains, ZK rollups | Enterprises with AWS lock-in | Banks, telcos, gov |

**Big insight:** You're not replacing Thales. You're saying "if you need per-draw cryptographic auditability, HSMs don't actually give you that, we do." Regulators like this story.

<div align="center">

**Pick R4 when:** Speed, cost, self-hosted control, and cryptographic auditability matter more than decentralized trust.

**Pick Chainlink when:** You need multi-party threshold signatures and ecosystem integrations.

**Pick drand when:** You want a free, public, decentralized beacon (academic, public goods).

**Pick AWS/Thales when:** You need FIPS hardware and don't care about per-draw verifiable proof.
