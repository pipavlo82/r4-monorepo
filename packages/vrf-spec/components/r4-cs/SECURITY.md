# Security Policy

## Supported status
This repository is an MVP intended for demonstrations and experiments. It is **not audited** and **not certified**. Do not use in production without an independent cryptographic review.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please use **GitHub Security Advisories** (the “Report a vulnerability” button in the repo’s *Security* tab) to submit a **private** report. This helps avoid exposing details publicly before a fix is available.

Alternatively, you may contact the repository owner via GitHub (@pipavlo82) to coordinate a private channel.

## Response & disclosure
- We'll acknowledge your report within 7 business days.
- We aim to provide a mitigation or remediation plan within 30 days for valid reports.
- Coordinated disclosure: we prefer publishing an advisory and a fix simultaneously.

## Scope notes
- Statistical-test passes (PractRand / Dieharder / NIST STS / TestU01) do **not** imply cryptographic security.
- Threats like state compromise, poor seeding, or side channels are out of scope for the MVP but are planned for future hardening.

## Safe harbor
We will not pursue legal action for good-faith research and reporting that follows the rules above and avoids harming users or data.
